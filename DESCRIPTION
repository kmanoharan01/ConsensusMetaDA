Description: This package provides a comprehensive suite of tools for microbiome 
    data analysis including data import, preprocessing, visualization, and 
    differential abundance analysis. It supports multiple statistical methods 
    including EdgeR, DESeq2, ALDEx2, ADAPT, and metagenomeSeq for robust 
    comparative analysis. The package handles BIOM format files and generates 
    publication-ready plots for taxonomic composition, alpha diversity, 
    beta diversity, and differential abundance results.
